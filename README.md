# Zuma3D

![screenshot](https://zupimages.net/up/23/11/9z46.png)
This is my first VR project on Unity, a 3D adaptation of the game Zuma, made as a student project in 2023. 
In this game, the player will have to defend a crystal from an upcoming threat from another galaxy. The game ends when either the threat is extinguished or the crystal is breached.

## Gameplay 
You can find [here](https://youtu.be/MgOVftO0qjg) a gameplay of this game.
## Team
We were a team of two people on this project : 
 - Evann Ambroisine, who mostly worked on the train mechanics (movements, additions, deletions)
  - Myself, who worked on level-design (decors, path, ...) and gameplay (aiming, firing, reloading, catching bonuses, ...)
